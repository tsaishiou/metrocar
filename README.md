**Metrocar Funnel Analysis Project**

**Overview**

This project analyzes user and ride funnels for Metrocar, a leading ride-sharing app, to identify drop-off points and recommend strategies to improve customer acquisition and retention. We utilize SQL and Python for data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

**Objective**
The goal is to provide actionable insights into user behavior, focusing on:

**Success rates at different funnel stages**
Ride distribution across peak hours
User demographics and platform preferences

**Funnel Stages**
We tracked users across seven stages:

Downloads
Signups
Ride Requested
Driver Accepted
Rides Completed
Payments Approved
Reviews

**Funnels**
User Funnel: Tracks the user journey from app download to ride review.
Ride Funnel: Focuses on ride request to review, analyzing ride cancellation rates and demand patterns.

**Key Findings**
User Funnel Drop-offs: Major drop-offs at signup, ride request, and ride completion stages.
Ride Funnel Drop-offs: The highest drop-off occurs between ride request and driver acceptance (35%).
Time-Based Analysis: Peak ride requests occur in the morning (7:30 AM - 10:30 AM) and afternoon (3:30 PM - 7:30 PM).

**Recommendations**
Check the signup age group bracket to recude missing data (currently age > 55 is missing in the options.)
Increase ride supply during peak hours to meet demand and reduce drop-offs.
Improve service quality to boost customer satisfaction and ride acceptance rates.
Incentivize Android users through marketing strategies and special offers to increase engagement.
